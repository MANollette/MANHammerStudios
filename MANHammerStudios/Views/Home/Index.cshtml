                                <p>
                                    I commissioned MANHammer Studios back in early July to work on my Ad Mech army. The studio offers fair prices for the work
                                    with the stipulation that the time of completion could be 5 to 6 months. During the commission process I got to choose the
                                    level of detail for my models which really helped me work out an obtainable budget while still getting quality work done. I
                                    received my my army in late September. Which was 2-3 months ahead of the predicted completion date. During that time I was
                                    updated regularly about the progression of the army via FB messenger or text. I also received pictures at different intervals
                                    or upon request to show the progression or completion of models. I also liked that if he had an idea for a model he would
                                    run it by me to see if I would like it or not. Overall I’m very pleased with the studios work and will definitely be sending
                                    them future work. Thank you again for doing such a great job.

                                <p>
                                    I had a fantastic experience working with MANHammer.
                                    Throughout the process there was ample communication to make sure I was satisfied with the outcomes each step of the way.
                                    I was also very impressed by how patiently my design wants and needs were listened to. My xwings came out exactly as I had
                                    in mind. Turn around time was a quick 2 weeks for my order of 5 ships. The work was done at a faster rate than that but I
                                    had to send ships in installments. The quality of the work an customer service is what will bring me back here for my
                                    painting needs in the future
