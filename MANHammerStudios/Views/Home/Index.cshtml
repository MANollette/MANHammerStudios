                                    I commissioned MANHammer Studios to work on my Ad Mech army. The studio offers fair prices for the work
                                    with the stipulation that the time of completion could be longer. I
                                    received my my army 2-3 months ahead of the predicted completion date. During that time I was
                                    updated regularly about the progression of the army. I also received pictures at different intervals
                                    or upon request to show the progression or completion of models. I also liked that if he had an idea for a model he would
                                    run it by me to see if I would like it or not. Overall I’m very pleased and will definitely be sending
                                    them future work. Thank you again for doing such a great job.

                                    I had a fantastic experience working with MANHammer.
                                    Throughout the process there was ample communication to make sure I was satisfied with the outcomes each step of the way.
                                    I was also very impressed by how patiently my design wants and needs were listened to. My xwings came out exactly as I had
                                    in mind. Turn around time was a quick 2 weeks for my order of 5 ships. The work was done at a faster rate than that but I
                                    had to send ships in installments. The quality of the work an customer service is what will bring me back here for my
                                    painting needs in the future
