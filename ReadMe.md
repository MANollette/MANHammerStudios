  <strong>MANHammer Studios is a small website project I've created. It's a proof of concept for now, but will be expanded upon if I decide to take my commission painting work a bit more seriously.</strong>
</p>

## Overview

The site is designed as an ASP.NET/MVC web application with responsive features. The site is sorted into grid columns, which auto adjust through media queries when the size of the window or screen says. The navigation options change as the menu shrinks as well. The home page consists of three columns detailing my work, experience, and testimonials. From the navigation bar at the top, you can also explore about me as a painter, view a gallery of my previous projects, check my pricing information, contact me directly, or review my painting blog.
